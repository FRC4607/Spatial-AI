# Spatial-AI
The goal of this project is to develop the process necessary to provide timely and reliable robot-relative game piece detection to the robot controller via WPILib NetworkTables. Simply put, if the robot is standing still for a second, this system will be able to detect game objects ***and where they are*** relative to the robot.

### Hardware
The following is the hardware used to during development. Similar (more powerful variants, etc.) will also work on deployed systems.
